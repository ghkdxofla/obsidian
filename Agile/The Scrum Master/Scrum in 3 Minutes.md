# Abstract
- Work is completed in short cycles of less than one month, called Sprints
# Content
## Product Goal
- The Product Goal represents the long-term objective for the Scrum Team and details why it is valuable
-  The work to be Done to reach the Product Goal is held in an ordered Product Backlog, which the Product Owner is accountable for
- Items at the top of a Product Backlog are refined to a ready state by the Scrum Team so they are small enough, and enough is known about them, to allow them to be Done in a Sprint
## Scrum Team & Goal
- The Scrum Team conducts the Sprint Planning event at the beginning of each Sprint
- Sprint Goal that is the single objective for the Sprint and explains why the team is completing the work
- The work to be Done and a plan of how to do it are captured in the Sprint Backlog
- The Developers are accountable for this artifact
## During Sprint
- Developers manage and work to produce a Done Increment that meets the Sprint Goal by the end of the Sprint
- By the end of the Sprint, the Increment must be usable
- A Definition of Done helps us understand the quality required for the Increment
## Daily Scrum
- Developers meet daily at the Daily Scrum to revisit and adapt the Sprint Backlog for the next 24 hours
## At the end of the Sprint
- The Increment is inspected by the Scrum Team and stakeholders at a Sprint Review
- Adaptions to the Product Backlog often result in more being known about the product and the domain within which the team operates
- In the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team seeks to overcome issues and improve its product creation ability
## Scrum Master
- The Scrum Master is accountable for the adoption of this empirical approach and the use of Scrum
- Scrum masters help remove impediments to the Scrum Team completing its work effectively
- They help the Scrum Team become more able to deliver valuable, usable Done Increments and are accountable for the team’s effectiveness
